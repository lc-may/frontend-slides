description: Create stunning, animation-rich HTML presentations from scratch or by converting PowerPoint files. Use when the user wants to build a presentation, convert a PPT/PPTX to web, or create slides for a talk/pitch. Helps non-designers discover their aesthetic through visual exploration rather than abstract choices.

# Frontend Slides Skill

Create zero-dependency, animation-rich HTML presentations that run entirely in the browser. This skill helps non-designers discover their preferred aesthetic through visual exploration ("show, don't tell"), then generates production-quality slide decks.

## Core Philosophy

1. **Zero Dependencies** — Single HTML files with inline CSS/JS. No npm, no build tools.
2. **Show, Don't Tell** — People don't know what they want until they see it. Generate visual previews, not abstract choices.
3. **Distinctive Design** — Avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Every presentation should feel custom-crafted.
4. **Production Quality** — Code should be well-commented, accessible, and performant.
5. **Viewport Fitting (CRITICAL)** — Every slide MUST fit exactly within the viewport. No scrolling within slides, ever. This is non-negotiable.

---

## CRITICAL: Viewport Fitting Requirements

**Each slide must fit exactly in the viewport. No scrolling within slides, ever.**

### Quick Rules

- Each slide = 100vh/100dvh with `overflow: hidden`
- All sizes use `clamp()` for responsive scaling
- Respect content density limits (max 4-6 bullets, max 6 cards)

### Content Density Limits

| Slide Type | Maximum Content |
|------------|-----------------|
| Title slide | 1 heading + 1 subtitle + optional tagline |
| Content slide | 1 heading + 4-6 bullet points OR 1 heading + 2 paragraphs |
| Feature grid | 1 heading + 6 cards maximum (2x3 or 3x2 grid) |
| Code slide | 1 heading + 8-10 lines of code maximum |
| Quote slide | 1 quote (max 3 lines) + attribution |
| Image slide | 1 heading + 1 image (max 60vh height) |

**If content exceeds these limits → Split into multiple slides**

**→ For complete CSS and implementation details, read `reference/viewport-fitting.md`**

---

## Phase 0: Detect Mode

First, determine what the user wants:

**Mode A: New Presentation**
- User wants to create slides from scratch
- Proceed to Phase 1 (Content Discovery)

**Mode B: PPT Conversion**
- User has a PowerPoint file (.ppt, .pptx) to convert
- Proceed to Phase 4 (PPT Extraction)

**Mode C: Existing Presentation Enhancement**
- User has an HTML presentation and wants to improve it
- Read the existing file, understand the structure, then enhance

---

## Phase 1: Content Discovery (New Presentations)

Before designing, understand the content. Ask via AskUserQuestion:

### Step 1.1: Presentation Context

**Question 1: Purpose**
- Header: "Purpose"
- Question: "What is this presentation for?"
- Options:
  - "Pitch deck" — Selling an idea, product, or company to investors/clients
  - "Teaching/Tutorial" — Explaining concepts, how-to guides, educational content
  - "Conference talk" — Speaking at an event, tech talk, keynote
  - "Internal presentation" — Team updates, strategy meetings, company updates

**Question 2: Slide Count**
- Header: "Length"
- Question: "Approximately how many slides?"
- Options:
  - "Short (5-10)" — Quick pitch, lightning talk
  - "Medium (10-20)" — Standard presentation
  - "Long (20+)" — Deep dive, comprehensive talk

**Question 3: Content**
- Header: "Content"
- Question: "Do you have the content ready, or do you need help structuring it?"
- Options:
  - "I have all content ready" — Just need to design the presentation
  - "I have rough notes" — Need help organizing into slides
  - "I have a topic only" — Need help creating the full outline

If user has content, ask them to share it (text, bullet points, images, etc.).

---

## Phase 2: Style Discovery (Visual Exploration)

**CRITICAL: This is the "show, don't tell" phase.**

Most people can't articulate design preferences in words. Instead of asking "do you want minimalist or bold?", we generate mini-previews and let them react.

**→ For complete style definitions (colors, fonts, signature elements), read `reference/style-presets.md`**

### How Users Choose Presets

Users can select a style in **two ways**:

**Option A: Guided Discovery (Default)**
- User answers mood questions
- Skill generates 3 preview files based on their answers
- User views previews in browser and picks their favorite
- This is best for users who don't have a specific style in mind

**Option B: Direct Selection**
- If user already knows what they want, they can request a preset by name
- Example: "Use the Bold Signal style" or "I want something like Dark Botanical"
- Skip to Phase 3 immediately

**Available Presets:**
| Preset | Vibe | Best For |
|--------|------|----------|
| Bold Signal | Confident, high-impact | Pitch decks, keynotes |
| Electric Studio | Clean, professional | Agency presentations |
| Creative Voltage | Energetic, retro-modern | Creative pitches |
| Dark Botanical | Elegant, sophisticated | Premium brands |
| Notebook Tabs | Editorial, organized | Reports, reviews |
| Pastel Geometry | Friendly, approachable | Product overviews |
| Split Pastel | Playful, modern | Creative agencies |
| Vintage Editorial | Witty, personality-driven | Personal brands |
| Neon Cyber | Futuristic, techy | Tech startups |
| Terminal Green | Developer-focused | Dev tools, APIs |
| Swiss Modern | Minimal, precise | Corporate, data |
| Paper & Ink | Literary, thoughtful | Storytelling |
| Deep Ocean Tech | Confident, tech-forward | Corporate presentations |

### Step 2.0: Style Path Selection

First, ask how the user wants to choose their style:

**Question: Style Selection Method**
- Header: "Style"
- Question: "How would you like to choose your presentation style?"
- Options:
  - "Show me options" — Generate 3 previews based on my needs (recommended for most users)
  - "I know what I want" — Let me pick from the preset list directly

**If "Show me options"** → Continue to Step 2.1 (Mood Selection)

**If "I know what I want"** → Show preset picker:

**Question: Pick a Preset**
- Header: "Preset"
- Question: "Which style would you like to use?"
- Options:
  - "Bold Signal" — Vibrant card on dark, confident and high-impact
  - "Dark Botanical" — Elegant dark with soft abstract shapes
  - "Notebook Tabs" — Editorial paper look with colorful section tabs
  - "Pastel Geometry" — Friendly pastels with decorative pills

(If user picks one, skip to Phase 3. If they want to see more options, show additional presets or proceed to guided discovery.)

### Step 2.1: Mood Selection (Guided Discovery)

**Question 1: Feeling**
- Header: "Vibe"
- Question: "What feeling should the audience have when viewing your slides?"
- Options:
  - "Impressed/Confident" — Professional, trustworthy, this team knows what they're doing
  - "Excited/Energized" — Innovative, bold, this is the future
  - "Calm/Focused" — Clear, thoughtful, easy to follow
  - "Inspired/Moved" — Emotional, storytelling, memorable
- multiSelect: true (can choose up to 2)

### Step 2.2: Generate Style Previews

Based on their mood selection, generate **3 distinct style previews** as mini HTML files in a temporary directory. Each preview should be a single title slide showing:

- Typography (font choices, heading/body hierarchy)
- Color palette (background, accent, text colors)
- Animation style (how elements enter)
- Overall aesthetic feel

**Preview Styles to Consider (pick 3 based on mood):**

| Mood | Style Options |
|------|---------------|
| Impressed/Confident | "Bold Signal", "Electric Studio", "Dark Botanical" |
| Excited/Energized | "Creative Voltage", "Neon Cyber", "Split Pastel" |
| Calm/Focused | "Notebook Tabs", "Paper & Ink", "Swiss Modern" |
| Inspired/Moved | "Dark Botanical", "Vintage Editorial", "Pastel Geometry" |

**IMPORTANT: Never use these generic patterns:**
- Purple gradients on white backgrounds
- Inter, Roboto, or system fonts
- Standard blue primary colors
- Predictable hero layouts

**Instead, use distinctive choices:**
- Unique font pairings (Clash Display, Satoshi, Cormorant Garamond, DM Sans, etc.)
- Cohesive color themes with personality
- Atmospheric backgrounds (gradients, subtle patterns, depth)
- Signature animation moments

### Step 2.3: Present Previews

Create the previews in: `.claude-design/slide-previews/`

```
.claude-design/slide-previews/
├── style-a.html   # First style option
├── style-b.html   # Second style option
├── style-c.html   # Third style option
└── assets/        # Any shared assets
```

Each preview file should be:
- Self-contained (inline CSS/JS)
- A single "title slide" showing the aesthetic
- Animated to demonstrate motion style
- ~50-100 lines, not a full presentation

Present to user:
```
I've created 3 style previews for you to compare:

**Style A: [Name]** — [1 sentence description]
**Style B: [Name]** — [1 sentence description]
**Style C: [Name]** — [1 sentence description]

Open each file to see them in action:
- .claude-design/slide-previews/style-a.html
- .claude-design/slide-previews/style-b.html
- .claude-design/slide-previews/style-c.html

Take a look and tell me:
1. Which style resonates most?
2. What do you like about it?
3. Anything you'd change?
```

Then use AskUserQuestion:

**Question: Pick Your Style**
- Header: "Style"
- Question: "Which style preview do you prefer?"
- Options:
  - "Style A: [Name]" — [Brief description]
  - "Style B: [Name]" — [Brief description]
  - "Style C: [Name]" — [Brief description]
  - "Mix elements" — Combine aspects from different styles

If "Mix elements", ask for specifics.

## Phase 3: Generate Presentation

Now generate the full presentation based on:
- Content from Phase 1
- Style from Phase 2

### File Structure

For single presentations:
```
presentation.html    # Self-contained presentation
assets/              # Images, if any
```

For projects with multiple presentations:
```
[presentation-name].html
[presentation-name]-assets/
```

### HTML Architecture

**When generating presentations, read these reference files:**

- **→ `reference/html-template.md`** — Complete HTML structure, CSS patterns, typography, slide types
- **→ `reference/viewport-fitting.md`** — Mandatory viewport CSS and responsive breakpoints
- **→ `scripts/slide-controller.js`** — JavaScript controller for navigation and animations

### Required JavaScript Features

Every presentation should include:

1. **SlidePresentation Class** — Main controller
   - Keyboard navigation (arrows, space)
   - Touch/swipe support
   - Mouse wheel navigation
   - Progress bar updates
   - Navigation dots

2. **Intersection Observer** — For scroll-triggered animations
   - Add `.visible` class when slides enter viewport
   - Trigger CSS animations efficiently

3. **Optional Enhancements** (based on style):
   - Custom cursor with trail
   - Particle system background (canvas)
   - Parallax effects
   - 3D tilt on hover
   - Magnetic buttons
   - Counter animations

### Code Quality Requirements

**Comments:**
Every section should have clear comments explaining:
- What it does
- Why it exists
- How to modify it

**Accessibility:**
- Semantic HTML (`<section>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`)
- Keyboard navigation works
- ARIA labels where needed
- Reduced motion support

**Responsive & Viewport Fitting:**
- Every `.slide` must have `height: 100vh; height: 100dvh; overflow: hidden;`
- All typography and spacing must use `clamp()`
- Respect content density limits
- Include breakpoints for heights: 700px, 600px, 500px
- When content doesn't fit → split into multiple slides, never scroll

---

## Phase 4: PPT Conversion

When converting PowerPoint files:

### Step 4.1: Extract Content

Use the extraction script to pull content from PowerPoint files:

**→ Run `scripts/pptx-extract.py` with the PPTX file path**

```bash
python scripts/pptx-extract.py presentation.pptx ./extracted
```

The script extracts:
- Slide titles and content
- Images (saved to assets folder)
- Speaker notes

### Step 4.2: Confirm Content Structure

Present the extracted content to the user:

```
I've extracted the following from your PowerPoint:

**Slide 1: [Title]**
- [Content summary]
- Images: [count]

**Slide 2: [Title]**
- [Content summary]
- Images: [count]

...

All images have been saved to the assets folder.

Does this look correct? Should I proceed with style selection?
```

### Step 4.3: Style Selection

Proceed to Phase 2 (Style Discovery) with the extracted content in mind.

### Step 4.4: Generate HTML

Convert the extracted content into the chosen style, preserving:
- All text content
- All images (referenced from assets folder)
- Slide order
- Any speaker notes (as HTML comments or separate file)

---

## Phase 5: Delivery

### Final Output

When the presentation is complete:

1. **Clean up temporary files**
   - Delete `.claude-design/slide-previews/` if it exists

2. **Open the presentation**
   - Use `open [filename].html` to launch in browser

3. **Provide summary**
```
Your presentation is ready!

📁 File: [filename].html
🎨 Style: [Style Name]
📊 Slides: [count]

**Navigation:**
- Arrow keys (← →) or Space to navigate
- Scroll/swipe also works
- Click the dots on the right to jump to a slide

**To customize:**
- Colors: Look for `:root` CSS variables at the top
- Fonts: Change the Fontshare/Google Fonts link
- Animations: Modify `.reveal` class timings

Would you like me to make any adjustments?
```

## Animation Reference

Different styles call for different animation approaches:

| Style | Characteristics |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Dramatic/Cinematic** | Slow fades (1-1.5s), scale transitions, parallax, spotlight effects |
| **Techy/Futuristic** | Neon glows, particle systems, grid patterns, glitch effects |
| **Playful/Friendly** | Bouncy easing, rounded corners, floating animations |
| **Professional/Corporate** | Fast subtle animations (200-300ms), minimal decoration |
| **Calm/Minimal** | Slow subtle motion, high whitespace, content-focused |
| **Editorial/Magazine** | Strong typography hierarchy, pull quotes, grid-breaking layouts |

**→ For complete animation patterns and code, read `reference/animation-patterns.md`**

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Fonts not loading:**
- Check Fontshare/Google Fonts URL
- Ensure font names match in CSS

**Animations not triggering:**
- Verify Intersection Observer is running
- Check that `.visible` class is being added

**Scroll snap not working:**
- Ensure `scroll-snap-type` on html/body
- Each slide needs `scroll-snap-align: start`

**Mobile issues:**
- Disable heavy effects at 768px breakpoint
- Test touch events
- Reduce particle count or disable canvas

**Performance issues:**
- Use `will-change` sparingly
- Prefer `transform` and `opacity` animations
- Throttle scroll/mousemove handlers

**Content overflowing slides:**
- See `reference/viewport-fitting.md` for complete troubleshooting
